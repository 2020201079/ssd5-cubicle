Intro:
Hello we are SSD team 5. Our project is to make a work cubicle. Here is the demo of progress of the project so far.
Explanation: 
1) As you can see the Aframe scene has two rooms. 
2) We have places two work stations in the present room. 
3) The objects are places relative to each other. For example the chair entity and desktop entity is present inside the table entity. Hence it was easy to replicate another workstation kept at the back by just rotation and change in position of table entity.
4) In the another room we have added a coffee machine for taking a break.
5) Added a window too for aesthetics. 
Future Works:

We hope to add a keyboard to the computer to make it more responsive in the future .
