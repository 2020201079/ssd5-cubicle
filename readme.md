# Achievement:
Here is the demo of progress of the project so far.
Explanation: 
1) As you can see the A-frame scene has two rooms. 
2) We have places two work stations in the present room. The objects are places relative to each other:
3) For example the chair entity and desktop entity is present inside the table entity. Hence it was easy to replicate another workstation kept at the back by just rotation and change in position of table entity.
4) Added a window too for aesthetics. 
5) We can give the instruction through the keyboard and play the song.
6) Click on the door and door is opening.
7) In the another room we have added a coffee machine for taking a break.
    -When we click on the coffee machine then coffee machine is shaking and  one coffee mug is appears.
    -And when we click on the coffee mug then coffee mug disappear.
8) Adding two digital clock one is analog and second is analog. Both are showing the current time.
9) Adding a switch board.
10) Adding fire extinguisher.
